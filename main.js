Check in an array if the multiple of odd numbers are greater than that of even numbers or vice versa.
You may assume the array will always contain positive integers and will not be empty.

Example: 
[1,2,3,4,5]
 1*3*5 > 2*4
 Expected result: `Odds win. 15 > 8`

[2,3,4,6,7]
 2*4*6 > 3*7
 Expected result: `Evens win. 48 > 21`
 
[22]
Expected result: `Even wins. 22 is even`

[19]
Expected result: `Odd wins. 19 is odd`
