/* 
ðŸ‘‰ Write your kata here!
 
Check in an array if multiples of odd numbers are greater than multiples of even numbers.
You may assume the array will always contain positive integers and will not be empty.

Example: [1,2,3,4,5]
 1*3*5 > 2*4
 Odd wins. 15 is greater than 8

 [2,3,4,6,7]
 2*4*6 > 3*7
 Even wins(48 > 21)
 Even wins. 48 is greater than 21

[22]
Even wins. 22 is even

[19]
Odd wins. 19 is odd
